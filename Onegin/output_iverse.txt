But, now I've praised the queens of fashion,

In the white heat of some dissension
He got so used to this immersion,
As with old friends, she craves diversion
or joined us poets. His conversion
in gossip's rambling and discursion
let not the poet's soul of passion
The arbitrary rules of passion
excited not a hint of passion:
than this humiliating passion
he sends a letter, penned with passion.
He gave this figure -- loved with passion,
facing a belle I loved with passion,
But you, grand tomes I loathe with passion,
gives way to nature's normal passion:
But when the hour of youthful passion
But, even by accident, her passion
in terms of poetry or passion --
the foreign words a maiden's passion
pouted, and swore in furious passion
the sufferings of tempestuous passion;
this was the science of that passion
he's viewed the boxes without passion,
to battle further with my passion;
at eighteen years, to some compassion.
My friends, the bard stirs your compassion:
when, in pale sky, the stars' procession

she wrote in French... what a confession!
I write to you -- no more confession
in casual letters of confession --
Well, I must make a frank confession,
As, lovingly, in his confession,
that virgin dream and its confession
will anger you in its confession.
I make magnanimous confession,

But, if you've kept some faint impression
Pleasant, in spite of its compression,
So let me with a kind expression
Vladimir's challenge found expression
in Russian never found expression,
What scorn I see in the expression
before such candour of expression,
the poet's heart found full expression,
how I interpret this expression:
ripen, and find a new expression --
and tried to write, but a hard session
She loved the balcony, the session
On these, with something like obsession,
Rage died, and jealousy's obsession,
Shade-like, in purposeless obsession
with every sort of home possession:

A thinker in a desert mission,
pours out its guiltless frank admission,
before she goes, she seeks permission
As soon as he appears, discussion
nothing was barred beyond discussion --
a lady -- what a grim discussion! --
Zaretsky rose without discussion;
your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
and plunged in tender shame's confusion,
an idle monk in glum seclusion,
The manor house, in deep seclusion,
I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
dear Tanya, lover of illusion;
What else? Quite drunk with love's illusion,
screened by a hill from storm's intrusion,
lost them without regret's contusion,
at verse, and hiss an imprecation,
Idle again by dedication,
O Adrian waves, my invocation;
and all our modish education;
it mastered him in slow gradation;
Tatyana sees with trepidation

Seeing herself as a creation --
the millions of two-legged creation

the fleeting works of my creation,
She'll not see him, her obligation
in indescribable elation,

of philosophic isolation,
our terror is their consolation.

Fired by the god of inspiration,
Whose glance, provoking inspiration,

Then gradually upon sensation,

To talk, to general conversation
I like a friendly conversation,

Lost in our backwoods habitation

The invalid's glad salutation,
When Eugene's turn for salutation
on words of foreign derivation,
finding in that no deprivation --
I pray God grant his soul salvation,
what kind of thought, what observation,
I thank him without reservation,
Tatyana listened with vexation
The kinsfolk in concerted action
of Russian verse, its force in action, --
with shelves of books deployed for action,
of his intent; and a reaction
of childish pranks: a chilled reaction
for nature's unadorned reaction
The nervous-tragical reaction,
the quintessential reaction
by what's called machinal reaction,
the brilliant crackpot: this reaction

A pause of silence and inaction,
she can't make out a single fraction
He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,

Lensky all evening, in distraction,
had long proved tedious to distraction:
what dream accounts for her distraction?
Rousseau (forgive a short distraction)
Tatyana never knew the attraction
It's true, the magnet-like attraction
But you perhaps find no attraction
In time past, objects of affection
I grasp a stirrup with affection,
I gave no rein to sweet affection:
I feel a brotherly affection,
with such a blissful, brief infection --
Whatever in this rough confection
showed one a pattern of perfection
the universe is all perfection;
arrested by the sheer perfection
and always the self-same objection;
on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,
for him all sham has found rejection,
I've drawn a plan and a projection,
and charming reverie's vain deflection
a dream's mute monument, reflection
the man of reverie and reflection,
what holds her in profound reflection,
is lost in obstinate reflection;
almanacs, journals of reflection,
Lending his tone a grave inflection,
He lacked the slightest predilection
what held me was my predilection,
To reading from this odd collection
He found them in some old collection,
but groomed an anecdote-collection

Another page of recollection:

Dogs, howling, rushed in her direction...

She wanders on without direction.

I weep, and pray for your protection..,

in dreams and cards and their prediction,

I must wake up with the conviction
Tatyana shared with full conviction

The château was of a construction
I know it's now in your discretion
How soft his glance, or at discretion
I would have had the indiscretion
untouched by trace of inhibition,
into his look, the exhibition
I've learnt the voice of new ambition,

The Larins kept the old tradition:
he changed the corvée of tradition

Perhaps to improve the world's condition,

she yields to it without condition

She's paid the sunrise no attention,
What cause has won me your attention?

he's bowed politely; his attention
Now brooding thoughts hold his attention
Now, she devours, with what attention,

Zaretsky draws up a convention
Could it not be that by convention

Deaf to her sister's intervention,
She went -- and Eugene, all emotion,
our hapless Tanya! An emotion
Tatyana in a deep emotion

What sort of roses, in your notion,
she drinks it like a priceless potion;
of wild repentance and devotion
Eugene forsakes the packed reception,
By dreams now sad in their conception,
More tolerant in his conception

brooding that is the lover's ploy.
How many times I made a toy
never come and like a spy
spends light and darkness in the dreary
on features known, but to that dreary,
across to her consort a weary
bored with hilarity, and weary,
Your horse, blunt-shoed and all unwary,
The two old ladies kiss and cry;
in unison repeat the cry:
but Tanya found she couldn't cry:
all egoistical and dry,
in flowers of spring it's drinking dry:
Alas, Eugene beyond all query
How long he'd been here, was her query,
have your fill of revelry!
before him roast beef, red and gory,
I meant to paint, with Alban's8 glory,
fortune, and dignity, and glory,
as sung of old, in years of glory,
and leave no faint footprint of glory...
there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
To me, Onegin, all this glory
and pâté, Strasbourg's deathless glory,
once more Corneille's majestic story;
at fifty, would prolong the story
this modish whirl, this social story,
to high renown my doleful story,
Only the ode, that solemn story!
Right at the outset of my story
But onward, onward with my story!
That isn't our immediate worry:
Now she's alarmed; in desperate worry
He rings at once, and what a scurry!
she can't; and in her panic hurry
and while the star still flew, she'd hurry
where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
boredom has just as sure an entry,
Yes, spleen was waiting like a sentry,
in order daily, chez Véry,1
addressed to Onegin''... ...'Well, that's easy.
Why have you gone all pale and queasy?''
for in our time, beyond dubiety,
Capricious belles of grand Society!
But, did they not corrupt society,
Alas, on pleasure's wild variety
another's grin was sly and shifty,
But, in a fearful huff, his thrifty
But then, oblivious of the city,
drive there, and with formality
of old-lime hospitality.
in far Moldavia, fit for pity,
the guests are feasted, good and hearty,
go off to sleep quite hale and hearty,
where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?
is this -- one sees from here the party:
devote to whist an evening party,
a ball here, there a children's party;
You'd never class her as a beauty;
Take Olga's shoulders now -- the beauty!
and look serenely on your beauty!...
I've known too many a haughty beauty,
inexorably wed to duty,
All flourishing; they send their duty.
meanwhile with a dissembler's duty
it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abbé.

with a quick look perusing lightly
will halt her horse and, gripping tightly
with perturbation and with worry;
with gown and slippers; tearing hurry,
what London calls, with humble duty
